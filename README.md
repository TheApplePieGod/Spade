A 3d engine I am writing in c++ with the goal of creating a PBR realistic environment which can be viewed from both on the surface and the planet as a whole from space. I also intend on making it cross platform, but I have not implemented anything other than Windows at the moment.

Feel free to check out my code; it is nowhere near anything production so I won't leave any installation or building instructions.

Here is a preview I uploaded to youtube a couple months ago: [Link](https://youtu.be/ChWMxhsLzy8)
